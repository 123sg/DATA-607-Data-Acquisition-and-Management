Data 607 - Project 2
================
SG

``` r
library(stringr)
library(dplyr)
```

    ## 
    ## Attaching package: 'dplyr'

    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
    ## 
    ##     filter, lag

    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
    ## 
    ##     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union

``` r
library(tidyr)
library(zoo)
```

    ## 
    ## Attaching package: 'zoo'

    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
    ## 
    ##     as.Date, as.Date.numeric

``` r
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)
```

Project 2 - Perform analysis on wide data sets
==============================================

We will analyze three different wide data sets:
1. Salaries by College Type - <https://www.kaggle.com/wsj/college-salaries/version/1#salaries-by-college-type.csv>
2. Google Play Store App Reviews - <https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps>
3. Employee Reviews - <https://www.kaggle.com/petersunga/google-amazon-facebook-employee-reviews>
These data sets have a large amount of data, so we will take sample of n size = 200, from each data set.

Salaries by College Type
------------------------

We will analyze salaries by college type. It will be interesting to see how the college type is correlated with salaries, at: 1. Start of careers
2. Different mid-career percentiles

We get the sample of raw data for Salaries by College Type:

``` r
collegeTypeData <- read.csv("Data/salaries-by-college-type.csv")
collegeTypeDf <- sample_n(collegeTypeData, 200)
print(collegeTypeDf)
```

The company continues to grow a rapid rate and that creates lots of opportunities internally (e.g. I'm on my 3rd role here in 3.5 years), there are usually secret projects going on building out the next product.  The move into Central London has also been very good socially and for mixing with colleagues, previously in Slough there were very limited opportunities to go for a meal or a drink after work and that really put a brake on say Friday evening drinks.

The people are incredibly smart, and that drives you to do better. - Great work environment... small teams, more productivity. Scrums are a great way of ensuring that no one in the team gets stuck in an issue. - Flexible hours (you'll mostly work longer than 8 hours a day though)

Everything we do connects to the mission and Mark talks about the mission in practically every talk. We encourage people to be their authentic selves. There's no "work you" and "personal you." There's just "you." People care deeply about each other here. And you have the ability to make an impact beginning on your first day. Some places it takes 6 months or a year to make meaningful progress, but here you jump in and make a difference right after orientation.

The decentralized, self-starter atmosphere strongly supports and encourages people who are motivated to try new things. In just months of being here, you'll end up having responsibilities that most companies wouldn't hand off from the legions of middle management for years. You're able to touch every aspect of the business, from the actual business side (TCO, business justifications, cost/benefit analysis, etc), to the deeply technical side (even all the way to choosing whatever technology, language, and platform you like). Every role has a huge amount of autonomy and responsibility.  Additionally, there are no middle-management drones here. Every person I've met here is top-notch, blisteringly intelligent and an extremely valuable asset to the company. Like most companies, there are some folks who might do better in other roles... but I've been overwhelmed by just how GOOD these people are. Coming from a different company where a lot of people just "coast", this is a nice, refreshing change.

    ## 10589 I definitely agree that this job isn’t for everyone however, it is a warehouse job and that does mean physical labor. The turnover rate is high because a lot of new hires see early on it isn’t for them and that shouldn’t reflect negatively on Amazon, if anything I find it great that they hire in bulk, they seem to give everyone a chance which I know a lot of us need. It boggles my mind over these negative reviews, your employer created the rules...follow them or quit? It’s really that simple. Benefits rock, atmosphere is great, you do feel valued despite reading that we are just a “badge number,” in reality the badge numbers are crucial because if your family calls in for an emergency they NEED to know where you are to connect you as soon as possible. They only require 24 hour notice for vacation, you can take pto if you feel like leaving, break rooms are fantastic and a wide variety of food/drinks/etc. I would definitely encourage everyone to apply, you won’t know if you like it until you try. If you excel at your job you are noticed right away, even on the first day.

I know some parts of Microsoft have their own ecosystems and processes which can be considered old school, but there's many facets of the company that are ran like a start-up where managements job is to just remove road blocks and let the dev/test/pm chain innovate. The company is so huge there are opportunities to work on whatever you want. Employee training is top notch, and you are free to change your career path as you want. The work life balance is very good, and the review process is mostly fair and honest. I haven't had any problems with politics, but that doesn't mean the system is perfect. Compared to the other big popular software houses (i.e. Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple), I feel that Microsoft is probably the best company to stick with and have a brilliant career. Many people I work with came from Google and Amazon and are much happier with Microsoft.

I am an ex-Googler and I have had great expeirences in both companies but I would have to honestly say leaving Google to come to Facebook has been the best decision I ever made.  We are all so busy, there is no time for politics and BS. We are solving huge problems and the work we do is played out on such a huge scale. Having this level of impact and being part of a relatively tiny team means you can really feel the value of the work you do. I love that we do not hyper hire, I love the fact that we hire such great people, people with a sense of purpose and some of the smartest people I have ever had the pleasure to work with.  WE have great amenities as well. Everything you need is here at the office. People don't mind coming into work, people are genuinely happy to be here and you cannot fake this atmosphere.  Feedback is well received and management do an awesome job of actioning this and listening to employees.

People trust each other to be top talents, so there is little to no micro management.

People are literally not important. Career development is a joke. There is only one upgrade path.  Failure in anything means a halt to upward movement. (I've seen great people stopped because of a relatively trivial error.)  Compensation is truly horrendous, and benefits are Scrooge-like.  Developers are a commodity, and work 80h weeks with oncall duty performing system maintenance.  This is the most seat-of-the-pants and blame-the-victim company I've ever worked for.  Hard work is not rewarded, because it's usually throwaway work.  Long-term planning is a joke.

Only one per level and function will be promoted, and 5% will get a raise, others will keep the same wage with 0 increase. Lateral move every 18months are encouraged which build no trust and no legacy in any function of the organization. Management is driven by individual ego and appetite to 'kill' peers level to be promoted

If you worked out the hourly rate, the pay would not be good.  very unhealthy competition where people are pitted against others that do not even perform the same function.

Work/Life Balance, if you don't plan then you will end up screwing family life (because there is always urgent work next door waiting to get addressed, you can easily become addicted to Amazon work culture )

It is a political zoo Lot's of opportunity for lateral movement but little for promotion. The process of determining who should be promoted is definitely biased and can be really unfair There are no silent stars here, so if your personality does not align with promoting yourself overtly always you will fail in this environment.

What keeps me wanting to find other employment is the retail schedule and the wages. Coming out of college the wages are probably the best there are out there for someone with little to no experience. Sustaining a family and making it a life long career is just not possible for the majority of people unless they can mange to move their way into management and that is no small feat when you are surrounded by incredibly talented and driven people.

Culture does not suit everyone. It's cerebral and you have to be able to operate in what the company calls Dive Deep mode: going into detail, asking why repeatedly, finding root cause for issues, knowing all your metrics (and we have a lot of them!). People whose preferred mode is influencing and inspiring people whilst floating above the detail will struggle.  Travel expense policies are stingy, e.g. economy class for long haul flights.

AWFUL HOURS... 5pm - 2am and mandatory overtime. This place is a SWEAT SHOP of the WORST KIND. It makes me wonder whether Jeff is aware of how his company is being run or where this business model was developed. I have never had a job which makes me unhappy as this. It's so bad that I will no longer spend my money with this company and support this modern day slavery. There is no regard or appreciation for the employees at all!

People are stretched to the maximum and pushed to the limit. Often employees are off with migraines , stress and no one really cares about their well-being. The HR department is set up to mainly serve the leaders and not the people. Very arrogant leaders who do not care about employees but only obsess over data and numbers. Everything is done to serve the external customers and nothing is done for the hard working people. You are expected to work day and night, no work life balance and no recognition. Poor management style, this cannot be sustained. People come and go because they hate working in such an environment.

    ## 22075 I've been an order picker on and off for three years now (for different companies), and it's a job I generally don't mind: you usually get to chill by yourself, listen to music and get some some good exercise. And that's exactly what the worst part about working for Amazon is: they take what should be a job that's generally low-stress (sometimes even fun) and make it the most stressful, difficult, and tedious job I've ever done in my entire life.  Like others have said, you're expected to meet impossible standards. Usually that's somewhat of a given when you're picking, and you eventually learn to ignore management and just give it your best effort until they get off your back. Even with previous picking experience, management was not sympathetic to the fact I wasn't making rate within the first week (despite putting up higher numbers than every other new hire, you're welcome). And yes, making rate here is impossible as it sounds. It's incredibly hard to find the item you're looking for because of the bin organization, and oftentimes your pick path will send you walking the length of a couple football fields to get to your next pick (that doesn't get factored into your rate, by the way). This is the kind of job that suits the young and athletic, others should apply with extreme caution (I have a friend who's working at Amazon to raise money to pay off medical bills he got from working at Amazon. What kind of life is that?).  But that isn't even the beginning of it.The absolute worst part about working here had nothing to do with the ridiculous demands and the frustrating nature of the work. The real horror of this job came from seeing all of my worst Orwellian nightmares come true. Your employer will always be suspicious of you, no matter how long you've done this job or how clean your record is. And you will be subjected to thorough technological measures to prevent ill behavior: metal detectors, sat-nav tracking, etc. You're encouraged to isolate yourself from others to better focus on the task at hand. Eventually, you'll come to realize that being employed at an Amazon fulfillment center is a lot like being stranded on a desert island: you're almost completely cut off from any contact with the rest of society, and while that may be comforting for an hour, you begin to feel your sanity slipping with each passing moment.  At every other picking job I've ever had, I always found a way to keep my motivation high. On break, I'd go outside and absorb the sunlight, or chat with a friend over lunch. There is no sunlight here. There is no music. There is only the screaming hum of machinery as you float into the nihilistic abyss.

They also move people up to a higher level as temporary status with the promise it will be permanent. However you stay at the same pay rate as the level you were at. Few people make it to perm with the pay raise. They ended the rewards program that based on performance you can get extra money every three months. Most the people I started with a year ago are at the same lvl or have been fired or quit. I do not recommend anybody to work there at this present time. Maybe later they might change back to being the company they were a few years ago

While it's wonderful that we all have total autonomy to determine what platform, language, and technology to use at every turn... do we really need to spend the next two months rewriting a build system? Or an issue tracking system? Or a multicast protocol? Really? These problems have been solved already, and there's no need to go back and reinvent the wheel. The decentralization, coupled with a focus on autonomy, leads to a strong "roll your own" syndrome. We end up with sometimes as many as twenty different solutions to the same problem, each slightly customized for a given team and unusable by anyone else.  Amazon requires patience, and an ability to sift through the chaos to focus on what's necessary. If you cannot prioritize your own workload, you will not do well here.

Once the dates are set, management is willing to cut any corner in order to meet them, which leads to technical debt and lots of legacy code and tribal knowledge about shortcuts taken. Also, you must take personal responsibility for your work life balance. You will always have too much work to do to have a reasonable balance, so set your own boundaries with management or 50 hour weeks quickly become 60.

If you have bad news, an unusual idea or background, you will be ignored or worse.

Compensation is good but increments are rather meager during appraisal.

Apple has attempted to hire people from the B2B world for Business Manager positions with the promise that even though you're in a retail environment, it's not really a retail job and that working hours are 9-5. That's a complete lie.

Rate sucks. Long hours. The work shift you initially choose should be the one you get. No real breaks, since they time you to and from the work station to the break room.

Difficult to take time off (at least my manager wouldn't allow us to take time off, even unpaid, if we didn't have the vacation time), which seemed ridiculous considering it was an hourly part-time position.

I say this because the next downside to the job is that while you may move up rapidly through the lower rungs in a retail store, management opportunities are hard to come by.

Internal competition is still fostered over teamwork. This creates suboptimal solutons. Even the 'collaboration' award has been awarded to an individual in the past few years. Self-promotion is critical to getting a good review - self-promotion is a virtue here, being humble wouldn't be a good career strategy. Culture to work fast and avoid input that might slow you down - even if it is input needed to improve the outcome. It is worse to deliver late than it is to deliver badly or to deliver an ineffective solution. Lack of effective leaders in many senior positions - success as a technician does not make for success as a leader.

Make sure you understand the dynamics and culture of the team you're thinking of working with. It can either be a horrible experience of an awesome one. Good news is if you're not happy, there's plenty of other divisions and groups to work for. Another con is Microsoft is famous for its BGHS (Big Giant Head Syndrome). Meetings are always rat-hole'd by smarty pants that feel it's important to argue and debate details to the point that you'll be lucky to get through 2-3 slides of your presentation. Some people are difficult to work with because they are very extroverted and opinionated. Having strong communication skills is paramount to surviving here.

Need better software engineering principles instead of just the Wild West approach. Sub-par health benefits. A company that "cheaps out" on most/all quality-of-life and work-life investments and is proud of it. Feels like working at a startup without the promise of getting wealthy. Long hours, "always at work" feeling. Upper-middle management can be inept jerks.

Its a fast moving place which I also love but can be challenging as things we work on can change quickly so you need to be super adaptable but the dynamic nature of the role and the company makes it interesting and never dull.

    ## 25248 Senior management at Amazon is surprisingly hands-on for a company that prizes autonomy as highly as Amazon. Yet, the hands-on nature, coming as it does from someone with "senior vice president" in their title, ends up randomizing entire teams. When an SVP wants an answer to a question, hordes of engineers are taken off their existing projects and moved all around. I would advise the senior leadership to be more the visionaries we expect them to be - and leave the tactical stuff to their teams.

They are so concerned with ranking people and being 'transparent', that they hesitate to praise you, for fear you will construe it as an indication of raise/promotion.

Create more opportunity for top thinkers to contribute in meaningful ways. Remember that competition is outside the company and winning against them is more important than internal competition. Hopefully this is changing somewhat now with new leadership at the helm.

Associates are put in places where there are business needs versus understanding the associate's strengths (example a leg handicap would work better in Singles than in AFE). Machinery is getting old, and someone needs to vacuum under the tape machines. Teamwork needs improvement. Schedule transfers should not take more than a year to be approved.
